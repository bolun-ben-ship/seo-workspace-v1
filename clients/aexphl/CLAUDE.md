## Env Vars — Two Places Required

Claude Code's Bash tool does NOT source `~/.zshrc`. Any API key set only there will show as `NOT SET`.

**Every key must be in BOTH:**
1. `~/.zshrc` — for terminal sessions
2. `~/.claude/settings.json` under the `env` block — for Claude Code Bash access

Current keys registered for this workspace:
- `WEBFLOW_AEXPHL_TOKEN` — Webflow API (in settings.json ✅)
- `AEXPHL_GOOGLE_KEY` — Google credentials (GSC + GA4)
- `MAILCHIMP_API_KEY` — Mailchimp (in settings.json ✅)
- `MONDAY_API_KEY` — Monday.com (in settings.json ✅)
- `CALENDLY_API_KEY` — Calendly (add when ready — see Mailchimp Sync section)

When adding a new key, update both files immediately.

## Active AI SEO Pipeline

**Campaign:** 2026-03-23 → 2026-06-23 (3 months)
**Webflow collection ID:** `66104d468c50c15134bf0447` (Blog Posts)

Scheduled tasks running (see Scheduled tab in Claude Code sidebar):
- `aexphl-weekly-blogs` — every Monday 9am, writes + pushes 5 blog drafts
- `aexphl-monthly-onpage` — 23rd of each month 9am, full audit + on-page execution

**Required:** `~/.claude/settings.json` must have `Bash`, `Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, `WebSearch`, `WebFetch` in `permissions.allow` — otherwise tasks will prompt for approval on every run.

**Manual items still outstanding:**
- noIndex `/landing-page` and `/landing-page-v2` in Webflow Designer
- 4 schema JSON-LD blocks (see `implementation/IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN-2026-03-23.md` Category F)

**Completed since pipeline launch:**
- Internal linking — 46 links injected across 17 blog posts (6 published + 11 drafts) on 2026-03-24 via Webflow CMS API. Plan + report: `implementation/INTERNAL-LINKS-PLAN-2026-03-24.md` / `INTERNAL-LINKS-REPORT-2026-03-24.md`
- Mailchimp lead sync — set up 2026-03-24; upgraded 2026-03-25 to full 4-source sync: Webflow forms + Calendly (all bookings, phone/location/event populated) + Monday delta sync (ongoing, not one-time) + deduplication by email hash. Audience ID: `bba8715471`

## Mailchimp Integration

- **Audience:** AEXPHL (`bba8715471`) — `enquiry@aexphl.com`
- **Sync script:** `scripts/mailchimp-sync.sh`
- **State file:** `scripts/mailchimp-sync-state.json` (tracks last sync timestamp)
- **Log file:** `scripts/mailchimp-sync.log`
- **Scheduled task:** `aexphl-mailchimp-sync` (hourly)

**Tags applied:**
- `source:webflow` — Webflow contactForm submissions
- `source:calendly` — all Calendly bookings
  - `event:borrowing-cap` — "Check your borrowing capacity or Refinance options"
  - `event:next-available` — "Next Available Appointment"
  - `event:discovery-call` — "Schedule Your Discovery Call"
  - `event:loan-consult` — "Loan Consultation" (broker-specific)
  - `event:{slugified-name}` — any other event type
  - `broker:shaun` / `broker:tim` / `broker:charu` — who they booked with
- `source:whatsapp-manychat` + `lead-type:high-intent` — ManyChat completed intake (native MC integration)
- `source:monday-import` — all Monday.com imports (ongoing delta sync)
  - `monday:lead` + `monday-status:{status}` — from Leads board
  - `monday:customer` — from Customers board
  - `broker:shaun` / `broker:tim` — lead owner (Leads board only)

**Merge fields populated (created 2026-03-24, extended 2026-03-25):**
- `FNAME`, `LNAME`, `PHONE` — standard fields. **PHONE is always sent explicitly (even as empty string) to overwrite any previously corrupted values.** Never skip PHONE in the merge payload — omitting it leaves garbage in place.
- `WHATSAPP` — WhatsApp number (from Monday Leads / Webflow)
- `SERVICES` — Interested services or event type booked
- `LEADSTAT` — Lead status (from Monday Leads)
- `LOCATION` — Country / region (from Calendly Q&A + Monday Leads)
- `CAMPAIGN` — Campaign source (from Monday Leads)
- `LSOURCE` — Lead capture source (calendly / webflow / monday)
- `EMPLOY` — Employment status (from Monday Customers)
- `IMMIGR` — Immigration status (from Monday Customers)
- `BROKER` — Assigned broker name
- `COUNTRY` — Country of residence (from Monday Customers)
- `AGE` — Age (from Monday Customers)
- `MARITAL` — Marital status (from Monday Customers)
- `JOBTITLE` — Job title (from Monday Customers)
- `INCOME` — Annual income AUD (from Monday Customers)
- `CUSTTYPE` — Customer type e.g. High Net Worth (from Monday Customers)
- `MEETDATE` — Original booking / meeting date

**Monday.com boards mapped:**
- `1907973121` Leads — owner-filtered (Shaun Rattray + Tim Raes only), delta sync hourly
- `1917616922` Customers — all entries, delta sync hourly
- `1917636634` Referrers → **SKIPPED** (referral partners, not leads)
- All other boards → **SKIPPED** (operational/internal)

**Deduplication:** All sources use Mailchimp PUT upsert on email hash — duplicates across Monday, Calendly, and Webflow automatically merge on the same contact record.

**Field write rules:**
- Empty string fields (non-PHONE) are NOT sent — existing data is never overwritten with blank
- `PHONE` is ALWAYS sent (even as empty string) — this actively clears any garbage values from prior runs
- Real phone numbers only go to PHONE if they contain at least one digit

**Data quality as of 2026-03-26 (after cleanup):**

| Segment | Contacts | FNAME | LNAME | PHONE | COUNTRY |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `monday:customer` | 592 | 100% | 97% | 28% | 33% |
| `monday:lead` only | 84 | 100% | 95% | 0% | 0% |
| `source:calendly` | 91 | 31% | 30% | 0% | 5% |

Low phone/country fill rates reflect sparse data in Monday — not a script issue.
Calendly name fill rate is low because most bookings don't capture full name in the form.

**Cleanup script:** `scripts/mailchimp-cleanup.py` — run if merge field corruption is ever suspected. Pulls fresh data from Monday, fixes garbled PHONE fields, populates FNAME/LNAME/COUNTRY where missing. Safe to re-run any time.

**Google Ads Customer Match CSV:** `scripts/google-ads-customer-match.csv` — 592 customer rows with full name + phone/country where available. Regenerate after any major sync or cleanup by running the generation script at the bottom of mailchimp-cleanup.py (or manually via the Mailchimp API).

**Calendly API note:** Token requires `scheduled_events:read` scope (not `users:read`). User URI hardcoded as `ACGBPK2OIQ3QPH3G` (decoded from JWT). Token set in both `~/.zshrc` and `~/.claude/settings.json`.

**To force full re-sync of Monday:**
Set `monday_last_sync` to `"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z"` in `scripts/mailchimp-sync-state.json`, then run `bash scripts/mailchimp-sync.sh`. This re-processes all Monday records and overwrites Mailchimp with fresh data (including clearing any PHONE corruption).

## Context Loading Rules

When a task involves SEO, content, marketing, copywriting, or strategy — load these before responding:

| File | When to read |
|---|---|
| `context/client-info.md` | Any business or client-facing task |
| `context/tone-guide.md` | Any writing task — blog posts, copy, emails, CTAs |
| `context/strategy.md` | Content, SEO, growth, or channel strategy tasks |
| `context/personal-info.md` | Copywriting, brand voice, Tim's POV, tone |
| `context/current-data.md` | Stats, web assets, market priorities, baselines |

Read only the files relevant to the task — not all four every time.

---

## Voice & Tone

- Clear, direct, no fluff
- Tim's voice: integrity-first, relationship-driven, anti-fear-marketing
- Audience: ambitious Aussie expat professionals (Singapore, HK, Dubai primary)
- Entry points: borrowing capacity check → refinance → full origination

### MANDATORY after any skill change
1. Edit in `seo-workflow/{skill}/SKILL.md`
2. Update `SKILLS-REFERENCE.md` — entry must reflect the change

This file is read by `/start-client` on workspace open.
Keeping it accurate means every session starts with correct context.

## API Key Security

**NEVER share API keys, tokens, or credentials in the chat.** If a key is accidentally shared:
1. Immediately go to the platform and revoke/regenerate it
2. Update `~/.zshrc` with the new key
3. Update `~/.claude/settings.json` env block with the new key
4. Restart Claude Code

This applies to: Mailchimp API keys, Webflow tokens, Google credentials, Calendly tokens — everything.

---

## Never
- Generic broker tone ("we're here to help you achieve your dream home")
- Fear-based framing
- Hardcode tokens or credentials in any output file
- Share API keys or tokens in chat — rotate immediately if this happens
- Execute CMS or file changes without explicit approval
